# Workly


## Description

Workly is a fullstack application and the first large project I worked on. My main motivation going into this was to learn more about programming, and web development. My idea behind this project was to develop an application for a company and his employees to input their hours, view the hours, and create invoices, since they were previously doing it by hand. Ultimately, this project was to save my client hours when calculating 30 different employees' time sheets. Eventually, others heard about the project I was working on and also wanted to integrate this application into their companies.

## Languages
