# Workly

Workly is a fullstack application and the first large project I worked on. My main motivation going into this was to learn more about programming, more specifically web development using tools such as css, html, flask, and JS, in addition to many powerful libraries. My idea behind this project was to develop an application for my dads company for his employies to input their hours and view them to create invoices, since they were previously doing it by hand. Ultimately this project was to save my dad hours when calculating 30 different employies time sheets. Eventually my family heard about the project I was working on and also wanted to integrate this application into their companies.
